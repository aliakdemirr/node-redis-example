# node-redis-example

What I mentioned in my medium post is a repo created to explain the operations on the Redis CLI on node.js.

#### Technologies required for the project

- Docker
- Node.js
- Redis-Pro (DB interface)

####  To run the project

1 ) yarn | | npm install

2 ) docker compose up -d

Note: (You can add Node.js to docker-compose.yml if you wish. I didn't put it in a container as it's already on my computer.)
